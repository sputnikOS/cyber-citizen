When to Equalize
There are five times when you might equalize a sound
in a recording session.
1) Equalizing when solo recording onto multitrack
2) Equalizing in the mix when recording onto the multitrack
3) Equalizing in solo during mixdown
4) Equalizing in the mix during mixdown
5) Equalizing the entire mix during mastering

### How to Equalize: 
 - Reset the volume controls to "0."
 - LISTEN. Don't touch the knobs until you know what you want to do. 
	 - Is the sound muddy? (Cut 100-800Hz, set bandwidth to thin)
	 - Is there irritation- is the sound honky? (Cut 1000-5000Hz, set bandwidth as thin as possible)
	 - Is the sound bright enough? (Boost Highs 1000-8000Hz, set bandwidth to medium wide)
-  Find the frequency to be boosted/cut by sweeping the volume.
- Return the volume knob back to "0".

## COMPRESSORS

| Setting     | Function                                                         | Common Ranges                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Threshold   | Volume level where compression starts                            | -20 dB to -10 dB (Vocals), -40 dB (Glue)   |
| Ratio       | Amount of compression applied                                    | 2:1 (Subtle), 4:1 (Moderate), 8:1+ (Heavy) |
| Attack      | How quickly compression starts after threshold is exceeded       | 1-10 ms (Fast), 20-50 ms (Slow)            |
| Release     | How quickly compression stops after signal falls below threshold | 50-200ms                                   |
| Makeup Gain | Boosts output after compression                                  | adjust                                     |

# Using Compressors
- Set ratio to 1:1, then pull down threshold to around -20db. Then begin to slowly increase the ratio until you like the sound.
# SSL G Bus Compressor for Recording Guitar (applied to the Master Bus)
- Attack: 30ms
- Release: Auto
- Ratio: 4:1
- Threshold: adjust until the meter hits the 4

### **Consoles**
#### **Key Characteristics of the REDD Console Sound**

#### **1. Warmth and Punch**

- The **REDD consoles** were built using **valve (tube) technology**, which imparts a **warm, smooth, and harmonically rich character** to the sound. This characteristic is often described as **"round"** or **"fat"**—a quality that is particularly noticeable in the **low-end** and **midrange** frequencies.
- The use of **valve circuitry** adds **gentle harmonic distortion**, giving instruments a **subtle warmth** that is pleasing to the ear without becoming overwhelming or muddy.

#### **2. Emphasis on the Midrange**

- The **midrange frequencies** (particularly around the **1-5kHz** range) were gently enhanced, which gave instruments like **vocals, guitars, and snare drums** a **forward, present** quality. This made the mix feel more **intimate** and **focused**, with an emphasis on clarity and intelligibility.
- This specific tuning helped the **vocals** and **lead instruments** stand out in the mix, making them more **vivid** while maintaining a sense of **space** and **depth** in the overall recording.

#### **3. Tight Low-End**

- The **bass frequencies** were carefully handled, ensuring that the low end was **tight** and **controlled**, avoiding muddiness. The **REDD consoles** provided a **full, rounded bass** while maintaining **clarity** in the **lower mids**.
- **Bass guitars** and **kick drums** recorded through the **REDD consoles** would have that **punchy, defined** sound that was often described as **"muscular"** or **"tight"**—especially in **The Beatles' early albums**.

#### **4. Smooth High-End**

- The high-end frequencies from the **REDD console** are often described as **smooth** and **musical**, without the harshness that can be typical of some other vintage gear. This made **cymbals** and **high-frequency instruments** sparkle without becoming piercing.
- It’s likely that this smoothness helped give the **vocals** and **piano** a **silky** quality, keeping the sound natural without excessive **sibilance** or harshness.

#### **5. Non-Invasive EQ**

- The EQ on the **REDD consoles** wasn’t as aggressive or surgical as other consoles of the time. It was designed to be **musical** and **subtle**, which made it very easy to balance instruments without altering the fundamental character of the sound.
- The **low-end boost** was quite **gentle**, and the **high-end** was softened, making the overall sound more cohesive and **symphonic**.

#### **Key Characteristics of the Pultec Console Sound:**

1. **Smooth, Defined Low End**
    
    - The **low end** on Pultec EQs is **warm**, **round**, and **tight**, often described as **punchy** without being overpowering. This makes the **kick drum**, **bass**, and **low-mid elements** sound **rich** and **full**.
    - The unique **Pultec "boost and cut" method** allows you to **add low-end weight** (e.g., **60Hz-100Hz**) without creating muddiness. The simultaneous **cut around 200-300Hz** cleans up the low-end, keeping it **tight and defined**.
2. **Transparent High-End Boost**
    
    - The **high-end** response of a Pultec EQ is **smooth and natural**, offering **air and sparkle** without harshness. The boost around **10-20kHz** can add **brightness** to **vocals**, **strings**, or **overheads**.
    - The high end is **gentle yet effective**, and when boosted, it enhances clarity and presence without sounding sharp or brittle. It's great for **shiny cymbals**, **acoustic guitars**, or **airy vocals**.
3. **Musical Midrange Presence**
    
    - While the Pultec EQs focus heavily on the lows and highs, they still provide subtle shaping of the **midrange**, allowing for clarity and focus on instruments like **vocals**, **guitars**, or **snare drums**.
    - The **midrange** isn't overly aggressive but provides a **musical presence** that sits naturally in the mix.
4. **Saturation & Harmonic Enhancement**
    
    - The **Pultec EQs** are famous for their **analog warmth** and the way they **saturate** the signal, especially when pushed. This adds **musical harmonic distortion** that rounds out the edges of any sound, creating a **vintage, warm** character.
    - The **Pultec sound** is not about dramatic changes but rather about **enhancing musicality** and adding depth through harmonic content.
5. **Characterful EQ Design**
    
    - The **Pultec EQP-1A** design allows for **boosting and cutting the same frequencies** (e.g., boosting **60Hz** while cutting around **250Hz**), which creates a unique **musical resonance**. This combination adds **warmth** and **definition** to the sound.
    - The **Pultec sound** is subtle, with a focus on enhancing **vintage warmth** and a **smooth** tonal quality that feels organic.
