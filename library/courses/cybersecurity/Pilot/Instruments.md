**The "Six Pack"**

The six basic flight instruments that are required for VFR flight, often called the six pack because they are arranged in a six-pack formation, consist of the following:  

- Altimeter (Pitot Static System)
- Airspeed Indicator (Pitot Static System)
- Vertical Speed Indicator (Pitot Static System)
- Attitude Indicator (Gyroscopic System)
- Heading Indicator (Gyroscopic System)
- Turn Coordinator (Gyroscopic System)  
    

**Altimeter  
**The altimeter measures the airplanes altitude above sea level, when adjusted to the proper local barometric pressure setting, which can be adjusted via a knob at the bottom of the gauge. The standard barometric pressure setting is 29.92. This will be adjusted as pressure increases or decreases in the areas you are flying, thus changing the reading of the altimeter.

**Airspeed Indicator  
**The airspeed indicator is an indicator that relays the aircraft’s speed in knots, mph, or both. This gauge uses the Pitot Tube, that is usually located on the wing of a general aviation aircraft. The gauges measures the pressure differences from the air going into the pitot tube, against the pressure from the airplanes static port, which is generally located on a side panel of the fuselage. This is the only gauge in the 6 pack that uses both of these ports.

**V-Speeds**  
These are speeds that are used to define specific speeds that are important to the safe operation of an aircraft. These speeds vary from aircraft to aircraft based on their design and performance limitations. These are expressed as in the indicated airspeed so that it is easy for pilots to simply look at the gauge and know what speed they are at. There are well over 50 V Speeds, however, the ones most used by general aviation pilots are listed below.  

- **Vso** – Aircraft stall speed in landing configuration (flaps down, gear down)
- **Vs1** – Aircraft stall speed with flaps and gear up (if applicable)
- **Vfe** – Maximum airspeed with the flaps extended
- **Vno** – Maximum structural cruising speed for normal operations.
- **Vne** – Never exceed speed, exceeding this speed can cause catastrophic structural damage to the aircraft.
- **Va** – Maneuvering speed. Pilots should not make full or abrupt movements above this speed. While experiencing turbulence, you should always be at or below this speed
- **Vlo** – Maximum landing gear operating speed. The max speed at which the gear should be operated.
- **Vle** – Maximum speed with the landing gear extended
- **Vx** – The aircrafts best angle of climb
- **Vy** – The aircrafts best rate of climb
- **Vg** – The aircrafts best glide speed

**Vertical Speed Indicator**  
The Vertical Speed Indicator tells the pilot at what rate you are climbing, descending, or if you are in level flight. This indicator uses the static port on the aircraft to measure differences in pressure, which allows the gauge to measure whether you are climbing or descending. If the static port were to become blocked, the gauge would just read zero.

**Attitude Indicator  
**The Attitude Indicator, which is also sometimes called the “Artificial Horizon” gives the pilot a site picture of the aircrafts wings in relation to the ground and sky, without having to look out the window. This gauge is primarily used in instrument flight rules (IFR) flying where the pilot cannot see the horizon outside the window due to clouds, weather, fog, etc. This is also useful for VFR (visual flight rules) pilots that find themselves in less than ideal visibility conditions. It can give you an at-a-glance indication as to weather the aircraft is turning, climbing, descending, or a combination of that. This can be a life-saving gauge should you become disoriented while flying.

**Heading Indicator  
**This indicator is sometimes called the “Directional Gyro” or DG for short. This indicator basically tells you which way you are pointing, based on a 360-degree direction. These are the primary indicators used for course headings by pilots instead of a compass since compasses are subject to magnetic errors, which the heading indicator is not.

**Turn Coordinator  
**Also known as the turn and slip indicator or the turn and bank indicator, this gauge tells a pilot if the aircraft is in a bank and if the airplane is coordinated. Coordinated meaning that the yaw of the aircraft while in straight and level flight or in a turn is not too far to either side, or that the tail is following directly through the airplanes flight path and not off to one side. The pilot can see this information by looking at the “ball” in the gauge itself. This ball is encased in fluid and moves freely to the right or left depending on the yaw of the aircraft. Pilots are taught to “step on the ball”, meaning that when the ball is too far off to one side, you need more input of that same side rudder pedal.
