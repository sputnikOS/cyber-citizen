Pre-Engagement\tThe first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.\n2. Information Gathering\tOnce the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.\n3. Vulnerability Assessment\tWith this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.\n4. Exploitation\tOnce we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.\n5. Post-Exploitation\tOnce we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).\n6. Lateral Movement\tIf other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.\n7. Proof-of-Concept\tWe create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.\n8. Post-Engagement\tFinally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.","x":-1480,"y":-1100,"width":531,"height":1080},

Before any target systems can be examined and attacked, we must first identify them. It may well be that the customer will not give us any information about their network and components other than a domain name or just a listing of in-scope IP addresses/network ranges. Therefore, we need to get an overview of the target web application(s) or network before proceeding further.","x":-920,"y":-540,"width":250,"height":540,"color":"#4673dd"},

From this, we can see if we have collected enough or dived deep enough. Time, patience, and personal commitment all play a significant role in information gathering. This is when many penetration testers tend to jump straight into exploiting a potential vulnerability. This often fails and can lead, among other things, to a significant loss of time. Before attempting to exploit anything, we should have completed thorough information gathering, keeping detailed notes along the way, focusing on things to hone in on once we get to the exploitation stage. Most assessments are time-based, so we don't want to waste time bouncing around, which could lead to us missing something critical. Organization and patience are vital while being as thorough as possible.","x":-560,"y":-340,"width":250,"height":960,"color":"3"}
